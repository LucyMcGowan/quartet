# quartet

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The quartet package is a collection of datasets aimed to help data
analysis practitioners and students learn key statistical insights in a
hands-on manner. It contains:

- Anscombeâ€™s Quartet
- Datasaurus Dozen
- Causal Quartet

## Installation

You can install the development version of quartet like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("LucyMcGowan/quartet")
```

## Causal Quartet

The goal of the `causalquartet` data set is to help drive home the point
that when presented with an exposure, outcome, and some measured
factors, statistics alone, whether summary statistics or data
visualizations, are not sufficient to determine the appropriate causal
estimate. Additional information about the data generating mechanism is
needed in order to draw the correct conclusions. See [this
paper](https://github.com/LucyMcGowan/writing-quartet/blob/main/manuscript.pdf)
for details.

## Example

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(quartet)

ggplot(causalquartet, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y ~ x") +
  facet_wrap(~type)
```

``` r
causalquartet %>%
  nest_by(type) %>%
  mutate(`Y ~ X` = round(coef(lm(y ~ x, data = data))[2], 2),
         `Y ~ X + Z` = round(coef(lm(y ~ x + z, data = data))[2], 2),
         `Correlation of X and Z` = round(cor(data$x, data$z), 2)) %>%
  select(-data, `Data generating mechanism` = type) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```
